Accessibility Considerations

For this project, I made a conscious effort to follow key accessibility principles from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Most of these concepts are intuitive and didn't need much thought when impleneting, as decisions for accessibility not only positively impact those with more difficulty, but everyone in general.

1. Perceivable

I ensured that any images used in the application include alt text where relevant. This allows screen readers to describe the images for visually impaired users, and for people who don't have enough bandwith to load images.

For text legibility, I made sure all important content is presented as text, not as images of text. This allows the content to be read by assistive technologies, and so that when zoomed in, the text is still legible.

I tested the app at 200% zoom to ensure it remains usable without any loss of content or functionality. All layouts adapt cleanly at higher zoom levels. I also checked the color contrast between text and backgrounds to ensure readability. For example, error messages use red text on a white background, and buttons use a strong blue against white for high contrast.

2. Operable

All interactive elements in the app are navigable via keyboard. I tested tabbing through the interface to confirm that there are no keyboard traps where users might get stuck.

I avoided flashing content to ensure the app doesn’t cause seizures. This includes avoiding any rapid or flashing red animations. I made sure that my background was consistently the saame colour for this, and probably if there were any flashing images int he future (maybe to make the games more exciting?), there would be warnings.

Any error messages remain visible for as long as they’re needed, giving users plenty of time to read and respond. Most of my errors stay on the screen as long as the person doesnt click it away or refresh the page.

3. Understandable

I structured the pages so that main content areas are at the top, and supporting content (like extra details) is placed at the bottom or side. For example, my quiz cards int he homepage start with a bolded title and the thumbnail, and then the features relating to it (like buttons) are placed near the bottom of the card. This was quite easy to implement because its intuitive.

Important navigation links, such as Back to Dashboard, are consistently placed at the top of each page. This helps users easily find their way around. In saying this,  used buttons instead of links for most actions. 

The color choices are intuitive:
- Red is for cancel or delete actions.
- Green is used for positive actions like starting a game.
- Gray is used for neutral actions like going back or editing.
This reinforces what actions are safe, positive, or destructive.

4. Robust

I used semantic HTML elements throughout the app, including <button>, <input>, and <a> for links. This ensures compatibility with assistive technologies like screen readers, and is also good for code readability and styling as well.

For any custom elements that handle interactions (like onClick handlers), I ensured that they include the correct ARIA roles (e.g., role="button"). This tells assistive tools what kind of element it is. To be honest there's not much to talk about for robustness.
