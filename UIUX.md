Throughout this project, I’ve applied a range of UI/UX principles to ensure that the application feels approachable and easy to navigate. My goal was to create a clean, cohesive experience where users can intuitively find what they need and interact with it confidently. One of the key principles I followed was ensuring that the interface doesn’t intimidate users—something that can happen if the design feels cluttered or inconsistent. To avoid this, I paid special attention to alignment, spacing, typography, and color choices.

For example, in the PastSessions component, I wrapped the main content in a centered, padded container (max-w-4xl mx-auto bg-white rounded-2xl shadow). This consistent framing of content helps ground the user’s attention and avoids any sense of visual chaos. The typography is simple and consistent, with bold headings like the “Past Sessions for Game {gameId}” title styled in a larger font (text-2xl font-bold) to create a clear hierarchy. I limited the number of fonts used across the application to maintain visual consistency, sticking with one clean sans-serif font for both headings and body text, following the principle that less is more when it comes to text stylings.

I also defined a constrained color palette for the app. Action buttons like “View Results” use a consistent blue (bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600), which signals interactivity and draws attention. Less critical elements like error messages use subtle red text (text-red-500) to indicate issues without overwhelming the user. By sticking to a harmonious set of colors—neutral backgrounds with strategic use of blue and red—I ensured that the design feels cohesive and calm, rather than chaotic. This approach follows the principle that humans like aligned, consistent patterns, and that math-based color harmonies help the interface feel "right."

In terms of visual hierarchy, I made deliberate choices around size, spacing, and alignment to guide users' attention. For instance, the Back to Dashboard button in the PastSessions component is aligned to the top-right of the page header using a flex justify-between layout. Its gray color (bg-gray-300 hover:bg-gray-400) contrasts with the action buttons, signaling that it’s a secondary action without demanding too much attention. This positioning, combined with the consistent use of spacing (mb-4 margins and px-4 py-2 padding), helps users understand the page’s structure at a glance and ensures that important elements like headers and buttons don’t compete for attention.

I also followed best practices for affordances, making sure interactive elements clearly indicate their purpose. Buttons like “View Results” have explicit labels, so users know exactly what action they’re performing. I avoided false affordances—for example, I ensured that table rows only appear clickable when they actually are. The “View Results” button sits within each row of the session table, making it clear that the button is the actionable element, not the row itself.
